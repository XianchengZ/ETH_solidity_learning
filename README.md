# ETH_solidity_learning

### Section Break Down

Section 2 - 4 use the same starter code, but we add more codes to accomplish more advanced features.

`Section 2` covers simple types of solidity. Since it is a small file, I didn't use folder.

`Section 3` covers import, export and inheritances.

`section 4` covers more advanced solidity. E.g. reserved function names in solidity like `recieve`, `fallback`, etc.

`section 5` moves from `remix` to local development, including the following:

- `solc`
- `ethers.js`
- `hardhat`
- `ganache`

...more to learn

Optionally for prettier setting:

- we can use `prettier` and `prettier-plugin-solidity` to enforce the format of codebase
  with other developers.
- Also add a `.prettierrc` file for specifying the format

There are some untracked old learnings, which include the `inbox`, `lottery` and `lottery-react` folder.
